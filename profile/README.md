# The CoDia Lab

Our research group, led by Assistant Professor Daniel DÃ¶rr, develops bioinformatics methods for analyzing molecular high-throughput data in the context of diabetes research. 
We address computational challenges arising from large-scale and heterogeneous data, integrating multi-omics and clinical datasets to improve our understanding of metabolic dysfunctions and their relationship with cardiovascular diseases. 
We develop pangenome-based approaches to study disease-related genetic variations, particularly in complex loci relevant to diabetes. 
Our work also extends to modeling epigenetic gene regulation and investigating structural genomic variations to reconstruct mutation histories.
